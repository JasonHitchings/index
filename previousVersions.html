					Hello and welcome back to the “what's new?” page. We've got a lot of nifty new features this update. The first update is the addition of rounded pictures instead of lame squares. Now, if you happen to like squares more than circular shapes then we also have a solution for you. It's called leaving my website and never coming back because I don't need that kind of negativity in my life. The next update is a brand spanking new page where you can see what I added in some of the previous iterations, and by previous iterations, I mean previous ones starting from the last update because I didn't keep a log of changes until then and I can't remember what I changed. However starting now all these fancy update pages you've come to know and tolerate will be moved to the new page after a new update rolls out. Another small change is that on the change log page instead of the white text you are seeing now all the updates are in a nifty light blue color because it looked spiffy and helped differentiate the pages. Also because part of the requirements for this were adding some CSS text changes and I didn't want to change the looks of any of the text on my main page because I've grown attached to how it looks. Well that's all the changes for this update. Come back next time for more updates than you can handle! Disclaimer: You will probably be able to handle them.

					Hello friends. If you're new to this website this tab will seem kinda pointless, but if you've been keeping up with all the iterations then it will let you know what exactly changed this time around. The first new feature is this section. I already told you what it does so we won't go over it again. Some other changes were the addition of CSS so that the site can stop looking like it was made in the 90s. The CSS gave us a spiffy new menu at the top that is way more radical than some lame bullet list. It also added a rad effect whenever you mouse over the menu options. Go ahead and try it out, you will probably only be slightly disappointed by how lackluster it is after all this hype.  You might also be thinking that these nifty little description paragraphs look different, and you would be right! For starters all the headers are now the same size, and the body of the paragraph is now in white text! This was done because white text is generally easier to read on most backgrounds, and it makes the bodies of the paragraphs stand out more from the titles. The menu at the top also had it's text color changed to white so that it would stick out more. You might also notice a neat little picture to the left of this that says “innovation”. That picture was added because it looks cutting edge and I thought the site could use some new age ideas. Anyway, that's all that's new for now. Be on the look out for more bodacious changes in the future!
