						<i> Jason Hitchings </i>

					<p>
						My name is Jason Hitchings and I am currently a student at Penn State University majoring in the Design and Development option of the college of Information Sciences and Technologies. I am proficient in Java and have experience in C++, HTML, PHP, SQL and C#. I got into programming because in high school I took some classes on networking and also spent some of my own time messing around with C# and I found both to be enjoyable so I knew I wanted to major in one of them in college. I ended up choosing programming because after taking some of the beginning programming and networking courses at Penn State I found that I enjoyed programming far more. Even though I am not going into web design I decided to take this course because I thought it would be intersting and make me a more well rounded programmer, since
						until I took this class the majority of my experience was in C++ and Java, with only a little bit of experience with the other languages. 
						The picture to the left is me with my dog Taz when she was a little pup. She is now a bit bigger and a lot more opposed to being held.
