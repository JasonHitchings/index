						<b> IST 250 </b> 
					</h1>
					<p>
						This website was made for use in my IST 250 class which is Intro to Web Design. This website started out as simply three headers and a picture but is slowly evolving into a more elegant website as the class progresses and I learn more with each Lab.

					<p>
						January 21st is the date that I created the first iteration of this website. Although it may not seem important January 2017 is the year that Donald Trump became our president and started our societies downward spiral into chaos. (probably)

						<i> Jason Hitchings </i> 
					</h1>
					<p>
						My name is Jason Hitchings and I am currently a student at Penn State University majoring in the Design and Development option of the college of Information Sciences and Technologies. I am proficient in Java and have experience in C++, HTML, PHP, SQL and C#. I got into programming because in high school I took some classes on networking and also spent some of my own time messing around with C# and I found both to be enjoyable so I knew I wanted to major in one of them in college. I ended up choosing programming because after taking some of the beginning programming and networking courses at Penn State I found that I enjoyed programming far more.

						<a href = "http://www.reddit.com/r/catpeoplehate"> Me irl </a><br>
					</h1>
					<p>
						I added this website because I spend a lot of time on reddit and because I couldn't think of anything else to link to that would properly describe my personality. I chose CatPeopleHate as my specific subreddit because overweight cats are a real problem in our society and we need to do something about it. The picture is simply because I identify with it on a spiritual level.

						<b> What's New!</b>
					</h1>
					<p>
						Hello and welcome back to the “what's new?” page. We've got a lot of nifty new features this update. The first update is the addition of rounded pictures instead of lame squares. Now, if you happen to like squares more than circular shapes then we also have a solution for you. It's called leaving my website and never coming back because I don't need that kind of negativity in my life. The next update is a brand spanking new page where you can see what I added in some of the previous iterations, and by previous iterations, I mean previous ones starting from the last update because I didn't keep a log of changes until then and I can't remember what I changed. However starting now all these fancy update pages you've come to know and tolerate will be moved to the new page after a new update rolls out. Another small change is that on the change log page instead of the white text you are seeing now all the updates are in a nifty light blue color because it looked spiffy and helped differentiate the pages. Also because part of the requirements for this were adding some CSS text changes and I didn't want to change the looks of any of the text on my main page because I've grown attached to how it looks. Well that's all the changes for this update. Come back next time for more updates than you can handle! Disclaimer: You will probably be able to handle them.
