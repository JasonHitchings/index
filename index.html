						Hello and welcome to my website. This website was made for my IST 250 class, which is intro to web design. It started out as a single html page with 4 headers and has been slowly evolving to what
						you see now. Going into this class I had little knowledge of even the basics of HTML let alone anything about CSS or Javascript, so I think it has been a valuable learning experience. I hope enjoyable
						looking around my site and seeing what I've learned how to do this semester.

					<h1 id = "Date"> 
						<font color = "blue"> January 21st 2017 </font>
					</h1>
					<p>
						January 21st is the date that I created the first iteration of this website. I've been working on this website on a semi weekly basis since then, so I think it is cool to be able to see how long I've actually been working on this. The other reason the date is here is because on the first iteration it was one of the few things I knew how to add, so I think it is a nice little reminder of how far I've
						come since then.

				</td>
				<td>
					<h1 id= "New">
						<b> What's New!</b>
					</h1>
					<p>
						This iteration has brought about a lot of visual changes. As you may have noticed I went from one big page in the begining with most of the information, and have now divided that information into their
						own pages. I think this makes the site look much less cluttered, and makes navigating it easier. I also thought that the menu at the top was getting rather full, so I think by grouping some things together on their own page it is a lot easier to look at and figure out what you want. I hope you think so too.
