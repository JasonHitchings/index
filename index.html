					<p>
						This website was made for use in my IST 250 class which is Intro to Web Design. This website started out as simply three headers and a picture but is slowly evolving into a more elegant website as the class progresses and I learn more with each Lab.

					<p>
						January 21st is the date that I created the first iteration of this website. Although it may not seem important January 2017 is the year that Donald Trump became our president and started our societies downward spiral into chaos. (probably)

						<i> Jason Hitchings </i> 
					</h1>
					<p>
						My name is Jason Hitchings and I am currently a student at Penn State University majoring in the Design and Development option of the college of Information Sciences and Technologies. I am proficient in Java and have experience in C++, HTML, PHP, SQL and C#. I got into programming because in high school I took some classes on networking and also spent some of my own time messing around with C# and I found both to be enjoyable so I knew I wanted to major in one of them in college. I ended up choosing programming because after taking some of the beginning programming and networking courses at Penn State I found that I enjoyed programming far more.
						The picture to the left is me with my dog Taz when she was a little pup.

						<a href = "http://www.reddit.com/r/catpeoplehate"> Me irl </a><br>
					</h1>
					<p>
						I added this website because I spend a lot of time on reddit and because I couldn't think of anything else to link to that would properly describe my personality. I chose CatPeopleHate as my specific subreddit because overweight cats are a real problem in our society and we need to do something about it. The picture is simply because I identify with it on a spiritual level.

						<b> What's New!</b>
					</h1>
					<p>
						This iteration brings brings us our hypest change yet! The addition of (drum roll please) a rock paper scissors game! This amazing game can be played by simply clicking the "play rps" button at the top of the page! Unfortunatly once you play it in order to return here you will have to hit the back button on your browser because for some reason the html file used for the RPS game wouldn't let me save any edits that I made to it, so I was unable to add a button at the top to return to the main menu of my page. Anyway that is all that is new for this iteration. until next time!
